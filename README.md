# Air Quality Index Dashboard üå§Ô∏è

A real-time Air Quality Index monitoring platform for Indian cities, built in 16 hours using Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. This project was developed with the assistance of Claude AI and Cline, showcasing the potential of AI-assisted rapid development.

## üåü Motivation

At 9:55 PM on December 27th, I wanted to check the air quality for my parents' location in India. Instead of using existing fragmented solutions, I decided to build a comprehensive tool that would make air quality information more accessible and actionable for everyone. By 1:55 PM the next day, this project was complete.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Live tracking of air quality metrics across multiple cities
- **City Comparison**: Side-by-side analysis of AQI metrics between different cities
- **Interactive Map**: Visual representation of air quality data with state-wise filtering
- **Forecast Predictions**: 5-day air quality forecasts for proactive planning
- **Data Visualization**: Intuitive charts and graphs for easy understanding
- **Mobile Responsive**: Seamless experience across all devices
- **Geolocation Support**: Quick access to local air quality data
- **Error Handling**: Robust error management and user feedback

## üõ†Ô∏è Built With

- [Next.js 14](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Type safety
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Styling
- [WAQI API](https://waqi.info/) - Air quality data
- Claude AI & Cline - Development assistance

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aqi-dashboard.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd aqi-dashboard
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env.local` file and add your WAQI API key:

   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_AQI_API_TOKEN=your_api_key_here
   ```

4. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## üåê API Integration

The project uses the World Air Quality Index (WAQI) API to fetch real-time air quality data. You'll need to:

1. Get an API token from [WAQI](https://aqicn.org/api/)
2. Add it to your `.env.local` file
